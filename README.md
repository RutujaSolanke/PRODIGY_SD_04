# PRODIGY_SD_04

Sudoku Solver ðŸ§©
This is a Java program that solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm. The program reads a partially filled Sudoku board and attempts to complete it by filling in the empty cells with numbers 1 through 9, while adhering to the rules of Sudoku.

Features
Backtracking Algorithm: Efficiently solves the Sudoku puzzle by exploring all possible configurations.
Constraint Validation: Ensures that each number appears only once per row, column, and 3x3 subgrid.
Sample Board: Includes a pre-defined Sudoku board with some cells already filled. You can modify this board to test different puzzles.

How It Works
Empty Cell Identification: The program looks for an empty cell (represented by 0) on the board.
Number Placement: For each empty cell, the program tries placing numbers 1 through 9.
Safety Check: Before placing a number, the program checks if the number can be placed without violating Sudoku rules.
Backtracking: If a number placement leads to a dead-end, the program backtracks and tries the next possible number.
Solution: If the puzzle is solved, the board is displayed; otherwise, it indicates that the puzzle cannot be solved.
